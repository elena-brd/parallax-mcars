            <p>

                just any designer, his famous creations happen to be the Audi TT and he was also affiliated with
                Volkswagen. The Chief Design Officer of Kia motors Peter Schreyer is responsible for the total overhaul

            <h3>KIA IS A TERM FROM SINO-KOREAN LANGUAGE</h3>
            <p>
                The term “Kia” originated from the Sino-Korean characters where "Ki" means to come out and "a" stands
                for East Asia. Combined, Kia is translated to “one, that comes out of the east”.
